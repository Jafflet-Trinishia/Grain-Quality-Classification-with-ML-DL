# Grain-Quality-Classification-with-ML-DL
This research improves wheat seed quality assessment for consumer safety using KNN and CNN algorithms, achieving high accuracy in identifying wheat quality, crucial for Asian countries' food security
# AIM OF THE PROJECT
As impurities in wheat (such as the presence of bug-damaged grains) reduce its purchase price and negatively affect bread item production, and as the germination capacity in the bug-damaged grains is also lowered, it is necessary to apply techniques that identify and classify bug-damaged and healthy grains using visual identifying factors. Thus, it is important to understand the grain quality and its significance towards society and help farmers. This project aims at identifying quality grains through machine learning and deep learning techniques

# PROPOSED MODEL
This project focused on providing a better approach for identification of wheat quality by using machine learning and deep learning approach.The comparison of these two techniques is made to identify the wheat quality classification.
The image dataset of Wheat of Binary class such as normal and broken are taken as dataset.The algorithm used in proposed system is KNN and CNN Convolution neural network. 

RESULT AND ANALYSIS
The proposed work is implemented in Python 3.6.4 with libraries scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib Keras, Tensor flow and other mandatory libraries. The grain dataset is applied machine learning algorithm K-nearest neighbor and deep learning algorithm CNN.

WHERE 
# •	MAE 
(Mean absolute error) represents the difference between the original and predicted values extracted by averaged the absolute difference over the data set.
# •	MSE 
(Mean Squared Error) represents the difference between the original and predicted values extracted by squared the average difference over the data set.
# •	RMSE 
            (Root Mean Squared Error) is the error rate by the square root of MSE.
# •	R-squared 
(Coefficient of determination) represents the coefficient of how well the values fit compared to the original values. The value from 0 to 1 interpreted as percentages. The higher the value is, the better the model is.

# CONCLUSION

The present work discusses a novel algorithm to detect and classify grains by using CNN  and k-nearest neighbor algorithms. And then testing the performance of those classification algorithm’s in terms of classification accuracy. This novel work increases accuracy values which are 91 % for grain(wheat) classification and cnn gives 92% accuracy compared with knn. The results of the current study have proved prominent success in detecting and classifying wheat.
